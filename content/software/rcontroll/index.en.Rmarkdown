*rcontroll* integrates the individual-based  and spatially-explicit *TROLL* model to simulate forest ecosystem and species dynamics forward in time.
*rcontroll* provides user-friendly functions to set up and analyse simulations with varying community compositions, ecological parameters, and climate conditions.

## Description

`TROLL` is coded in C++ and it typically simulates hundreds of thousands of individuals over hundreds of years. 
The `rcontroll` R package is a wrapper of `TROLL`. 
`rcontroll` includes functions that generate inputs for simulations and run simulations. 
Finally, it is possible to analyse the `TROLL` outputs through tables, figures, 
and maps taking advantage of other R visualisation packages. 
`rcontroll` also offers the possibility to generate a virtual LIDAR point cloud 
that corresponds to a snapshot of the simulated forest.

### Construction and manipulation of input files

As stated above, three types of input data are needed for a typical `TROLL` simulation: 
(i) climate data, (ii) plant functional traits, (iii) global model parameters.
Pre-simulation functions include global parameters definition (`generate_parameters` function) and climate data generation (`generate_climate` function). 
`rcontroll` also includes default data for species and climate inputs for a typical French Guiana rainforest site. 
The purpose of the `generate_climate` function with the help of the corresponding vignette is to create `TROLL` climate inputs from ERA5-Land (Muñoz-Sabater et al. 2021), 
a global climatic reanalysis dataset that is freely available. 
The ERA5-Land climate reanalysis is available at 9 km spatial resolution and hourly temporal resolution since 1950, 
and daily or monthly means are available and their uncertainties reported. 
Therefore, `rcontroll` users only need to input the species-specific trait data to run `TROLL` simulations, irrespective of the site. 
`TROLL` was originally developed for tropical and subtropical forests, so certain assumptions must be critically examined when applying it outside the tropics. 
The input files can be used to start a `TROLL` simulation run within the `rcontroll` environment (see below), 
or saved so that the `TROLL` simulation can be started as a command line tool.

### Simulations

The default option is to run a `TROLL` simulation using the `troll` function of the rcontroll package, 
which currently calls version 3.1.7 of `TROLL` using the Rcpp package (Eddelbuettel & François 2011). 
The output is stored in a `trollsim` R class. 
For multiple runs, users can rely on the `stack` function, and the output is stored in the `trollstack` class.
Both `trollsim` and `trollstack` values can be accessed using object attributes in the form of simple R objects (with `@` in R).
They consist of eight simulation attributes: (1) name, (2) path to saved files, (3) parameters, (4) inputs, (5) log, 
(6) initial and final state, (7) ecosystem output metrics, and (8) species output metrics. 
The initial and final states are represented by a table with the spatial position,
size and other relevant traits of all trees at the start and end of the simulation.
The ecosystem and species metrics are summaries of ecosystem processes and states, 
such as net primary production and aboveground biomass, and they are documented at species level and aggregated over the entire stand. Simulations can be saved using a user-defined path when run and later loaded as a simple simulation (`load_output` function) 
or a stack of simulations (`load_stack` function).

### Simulated airborne lidar scanning option

`TROLL` also has the capacity of generating point clouds from virtual aerial lidar scannings of simulated forest scenes.
Within each cubic metre voxel of the simulated stand, points are generated probabilistically, 
with the probability depending both on the amount of light reaching the particular voxel 
and the amount of leaf matter intercepting light within the voxel. 
Extinction and interception of light are based on the Beer-Lambert law, 
but an effective extinction factor is used to account for differences between the near-infrared and visible light. 
The definition of the lidar parameters (`generate_lidar` function) is optional but allows the user to add a virtual aerial lidar scan for a time step of the `TROLL` simulation. 
When this option is enabled, the cloud of points from simulated aerial lidar scans are stored as LAS using the R package `lidR` (Roussel et al., 2020) as a ninth attribute of the `trollsim` and `trollstack` objects. 

### Manipulation of simulation outputs

`rcontroll` includes functions to manipulate simulation outputs. 
Simulation outputs can be retrieved directly from the `trollsim` or `trollstack`objects 
and summarised or plotted in the R environment with the `print`, `summary` and `autoplot` functions. 
The `get_chm` function allows users to retrieve canopy height models from aerial lidar point clouds (Fig. 2). 
In addition, a `rcontroll` function is available to visualise TROLL simulations as an animated figure (`autogif` function, Fig. 1).

![*Figure 1: Output from a TROLL simulation using the autogif function in the rcontroll package. The image shows a vertical cut in the forest structure along the X-axis (in metre) with individual tree height (metre) on the Y-axis. The tree colours indicate the identity of the species and can be changed using the ggplot2 grammar. The figure shows the forest structure dynamically over 200 years of a successional trajectory starting from bare ground.*](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sylvainschmitt/rcontroll/main/inst/figures/troll.gif)

The horizontal axes represent the X-axis and Y-axis (in metres) and the vertical axis represents height (in metres). The thermal colour scale indicates the height of the points in the cloud, from 0 m in dark blue to 40 m in red.*](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sylvainschmitt/rcontroll/main/inst/figures/lidar.png)
