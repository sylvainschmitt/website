I am helping Bruno Hérault and Stéphane Traissac in the supervising of Nino Page. He realizes a master 2 thesis on the impact of selective logging on tropical forest. He will use the forest simulator TROLL to particularly assessed this impact in the context of French Guiana. Nino realized the master 2 of Tropical Forest Ecology (EFT) in French Guiana.
