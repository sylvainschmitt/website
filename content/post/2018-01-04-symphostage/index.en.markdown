I started the supervising of Émilie Ducouret. She realizes a master 2 thesis on the intraspecific variability of functional traits from *Symphonia* species complex. Émilie realised the master 2 of Tropical Forest Ecology (EFT) in French Guiana. Her work will direclty participate to the development of my PhD thesis. [Description of the subject](https://www.sfecologie.org/offre/the-return-of-the-individual-functional-trait-variability-in-the-symphonia-globulifera-l-f-species-complex-in-french-guiana/) is availble on the french society of ecology (SFE).
