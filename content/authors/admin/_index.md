I am a postdoctoral researcher in evolution and ecology working on tropical trees. I did my PhD thesis on genotype-environment interactions in the formation of intraspecific trait variability in tropical tree species, and deduced the impact on the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. I am currently involved in the TreeMutation project which focuses on mutation in the canopy of tropical trees.
