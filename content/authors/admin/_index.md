I'm Sylvain, an ecologist at CIRAD (https://www.cirad.fr), 
a French research center working with 
developing countries on environmental and development issues. 
I am currently conducting research into modeling the joint effect of climate 
change and anthropogenic disturbance on the dynamics of Amazonian tropical forests.
